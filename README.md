## n-Queens Visualizer

The purpose of this project is to provide a visual way to explore local search algorithms that generate solutions to the n-queens problem.

Todo-list of features:
* Implement all methods (backtracking, brute-force permutations, random permutations, simulated annealing, and iterative repair (local search))
* Animate movement of queen
* Speed bar
* Have queens be numbered
* Show number of iterations
* Highlight attack paths
* Show text explaining each search method
* Guided tour through sequence of possible search strategies
